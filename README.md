# A project for my CS class summative
Based on John Conway's Game of Life, or as I like to call it, GOLAD, Game Of Life And Death

# Usage
To use it just clone the repo and open the index.html page, I recommend utilizing a simple web server that can serve files as chrome doesn't really like loading other js files

# Technologies
- HTML 5
- Mjs (ES6)
- CSS 3
